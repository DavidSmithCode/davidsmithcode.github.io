# [](#header-1)David Smith (Ducks).

[Link to Blog](blog.md).

## [](#header-2)Blog:

The 'Blog' can be found [Here](blog.md). Expect the first post there to be about Encrypted Messaging. Feel free to ask me to write about something on Twitter i'll happily comply, not sure why you'd want me out of all people to write something, but yeah okay.



## [](#header-2)About:

I'll be attempting to write stuff, don't count on me to write anything worth reading, i'm not an expert at anything by any means. 


## [](#header-2)Contact:

I'll update this sometime, probably with an Email, PGP, Ricochet and XMPP. Note that i'm most active on twitter though, and you'll probably need to tell me to get on XMPP, Email or Ricochet through there anyway, perhaps with PGP if you ever so wish.
